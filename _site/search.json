Box Plus Minus is a basketball box score-based metric that estimates a basketball player’s contribution to the team when that player is on the court. It takes into account the player’s box score information (games played, field goal percentage, assists, rebound, etc), position, and the team’s overall performance to estimate the player’s contribution in points above the league average per 100 possessions played (Myers February 2020). The league average is defined as 0.0 and a value of +5.0 means the team is 5 points per 100 possessions better with the player on the floor than with average production from another player.\nValue over Replacement Player converts the BPM rate into an estimate of each player’s overall contribution to the team, measured versus what a theoretical “replacement player” would provide (Cappe February 29, 2020). A replacement player is one with a performance at “replacement level,” the level of performance an average team can expect when trying to replace a player at a minimal cost. That is to say, the player is on the periphery of the league. By design, the player of the replacement level has a VORP of -2.0.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram of BPM\n\n\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star Game is an annual exhibition basketball game featuring two teams of twelve composed of all of the top-ranked players from the Eastern and Western Conferences. The All-Star players are the ones being accepted to be the influential players in that season.\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\n\nExcluding the unrepresentative data\nFirstly, there are players that played few games during a season and therefore the reported VORP might not reflect their true performance on court. So, I exclude those players.\n\nnba_0 &lt;- nba_15_16 %&gt;% dplyr::select(c('Pos', \"Age\", \"Tm\", \"ALL_STAR\", \"VORP\", \"G\"))\nnba_0 &lt;-  nba_0 %&gt;% filter(G &gt; 20)\n\n\n\nTidying the Position Variable\nSecondly, most of the values of ‘Pos’ variable in this data are either “C”, “PF”, “SF”, “SG”, or “PG”. However, some have a mix of the two, like “PG-SG”. But as they are a tiny part of the data, I will exclude them.\n\nnba_1 &lt;-  nba_0 %&gt;% filter(Pos %in% c('C', 'PF', 'SF', 'SG', 'PG'))\n\nnba_pos_count &lt;- nba_1 %&gt;%\n  count(Pos, name = \"Count\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Count))\n\nggplot(nba_pos_count, aes(x = reorder(Pos, Count), y = Count, fill = Pos)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Player Positions\",\n    subtitle = \"Center position has the fewest players, while pointguard has the most\",\n    x = \"Player Position\",\n    y = \"Number of Players\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Count), vjust = -0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy I drop rows?\n\n\n\nMost of the values of ‘Pos’ variable in this data are either “C”, “PF”, “SF”, “SG”, or “PG”. However, some have a mix of the two, like “PG-SG”.

From the plots, we see that there were more players selected to be All-Star in the Southeast and the Pacific divisions, meaning that these two divisions were likely to be more competitive than the others. Also, none of the players that were being traded were selected to be All-Star, since good players are less likely to be traded.\nThe scatter plot shows that the age might affect the VORP statistics, and players with higher VORP values typically have age at around 25 - 30. The boxplot shows the All-Star players have significantly higher VORP values for all five positions.\nWith these observations, machine learning models can be fitted to the data to draw more in-depth conclusions.\n\n\nFunctions Used\n\ndplyr and tidyr: select, filter, mutate, count, arrange.\nggplot2: geom_bar, geom_boxplot, geom_line, geom_point, facet_wrap\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCappe.
